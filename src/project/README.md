# Abstract

Developing large software systems is not trivial, as these systems must have quality attributes such as scalability and maintainability. Therefore, it is important that they have an architecture that favors the fulfillment of these attributes. Understanding the architecture of a software – its structural aspects and patterns – is essential to be able to satisfy the desirable quality requirements. However, there is little support for characterizing and evaluating the architecture of systems, especially those based on services. Sorting Hat is a tool under development that helps in the process of characterizing the architecture of service-based systems. It uses the CharM model, which is being developed in the project of doctoral student Thatiane de Oliveira Rosa. Currently, the tool has an MVP (minimum viable prototype) of a frontend, with data from the smart city platform InterSCity. The tool data is collected manually, in an arduous and computationally automatable process. In addition, the frontend suffers from usability and fluidity problems, not being intuitive to understand. This capstone project aims to: provide automated data collection of CharM model metrics, as well as improve the usability and fluidity of the frontend.
